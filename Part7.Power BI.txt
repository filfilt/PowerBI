Part7.Power BI Over View
========//========
Power B! Desktop is a free application you install on your local computer that lets you connect to, transform,
and visualize your data.
With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to multiple different sources of data, and combine them (often
called modeling) Into a data model. This data model lets you build visuals, and collections of visuals you can
share as reports, with other people inside your organization.
The most common uses for Power BI Desktop are as follows:
1. Connect to data
2. Transform and clean that data, to create a data model
3. Create visuals, such as charts or graphs, that provide visual representations of the data
4. Create reports that are collections of visuals, on one or more report pages
5. Share reports with others by using the Power BI service

   why power BI Desktop
    =========//=======

There are three views available in Power Bl Desktop,
which you select on the left side of the canvas. The
views, shown in the order they appear, are as follows:

1 Report: In this view, you create reports and
visuals, where most of your creation time is spent.

2. Data: In this view, you see the tables, measures,
and other data used in the data model associated
with your report, and transform the data for best
use in the reports model.

3. Model: In this view, you see and manage the
relationships among tables in your data model.

---------------//----------------
	TRANSFORM AND CLEAN DATA, CREATE A MODEL
In Power BI Desktop, you can clean and transform data using the built-in Power Query Editor.
With Power Query Editor, you make changes to your data, such as changing a data type,
removing columns, or combining data from multiple sources. Itâ€™s like sculpting: you start with a
large block of clay (or data), then shave off pieces or add others as needed, until the shape of
the data is how you want it.
To start Power Query Editor:
Select Edit Queries > Edit Queries from the Home ribbon.
The Power Query Editor window appears.

    There are two ways to connect SQL (Import and DirectQuery)
If we use direct Query we should setup data gateway. For that we should install Data Gateway
from portal as seen in the picture below
