Part7.Power BI Over View
========//========
Power B! Desktop is a free application you install on your local computer that lets you connect to, transform,
and visualize your data.
With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to multiple different sources of data, and combine them (often
called modeling) Into a data model. This data model lets you build visuals, and collections of visuals you can
share as reports, with other people inside your organization.
The most common uses for Power BI Desktop are as follows:
1. Connect to data
2. Transform and clean that data, to create a data model
3. Create visuals, such as charts or graphs, that provide visual representations of the data
4. Create reports that are collections of visuals, on one or more report pages
5. Share reports with others by using the Power BI service

======================//================================
   Steps:
	-Open Power BI 
	-Get Data From some data center (eg: From SQL Server)
	-SQL server
	-Put Server and Database Then OK
	-Select tables
	-Transform Dara (Mean Create Model)

Work1:Make Table Student+(DepartmentId and DepartmentName)
	-open Student table 
	-Expand Department
	-Select (DepartmentId and DepartmentName) only
	-Close and Apply

Work2:Create New table and Show some columns(ID,Fname,Lname)
	-Expand student

    =========//=======

There are three views available in Power Bl Desktop,
which you select on the left side of the canvas. The
views, shown in the order they appear, are as follows:

1 Report: In this view, you create reports and
visuals, where most of your creation time is spent.

2. Data: In this view, you see the tables, measures,
and other data used in the data model associated
with your report, and transform the data for best
use in the reports model.

3. Model: In this view, you see and manage the
relationships among tables in your data model.

---------------//----------------
	TRANSFORM AND CLEAN DATA, CREATE A MODEL
In Power BI Desktop, you can clean and transform data using the built-in Power Query Editor.
With Power Query Editor, you make changes to your data, such as changing a data type,
removing columns, or combining data from multiple sources. It’s like sculpting: you start with a
large block of clay (or data), then shave off pieces or add others as needed, until the shape of
the data is how you want it.
To start Power Query Editor:
Select Edit Queries > Edit Queries from the Home ribbon.
The Power Query Editor window appears.
	---------------//-----------------

    There are two ways to connect SQL (Import and DirectQuery)
If we use direct Query we should setup data gateway. For that we should install Data Gateway
from portal as seen in the picture below

	HOW TO GATEWAY WORKS
	  ========//=======
Types of gateways
There are two different types of gateways, each for a
different scenario:
On-premises data gateway allows multiple users to
connect to multiple on-premises data sources. You can
use an on-premises data gateway with all supported
services, with a single gateway installation. This gateway is
well-suited to complex scenarios with multiple people
accessing multiple data sources.
On-premises data gateway (personal mode) allows one
user to connect to sources, and can’t be shared with
others. An on-premises data gateway (personal mode) can
be used only with Power BI. This gateway is well-suited to
scenarios where youre the only person who creates
reports, and you don’t need to share any data sources
with others.
