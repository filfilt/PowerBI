	HOW TO GATEWAY WORKS
	  ========//=======
Types of gateways
There are two different types of gateways, each for a
different scenario:

On-premises data gateway allows multiple users to
connect to multiple on-premises data sources. You can
use an on-premises data gateway with all supported
services, with a single gateway installation. This gateway is
well-suited to complex scenarios with multiple people
accessing multiple data sources.

On-premises data gateway (personal mode) allows one
user to connect to sources, and can’t be shared with
others. An on-premises data gateway (personal mode) can
be used only with Power BI. This gateway is well-suited to
scenarios where youre the only person who creates
reports, and you don’t need to share any data sources
with others.
