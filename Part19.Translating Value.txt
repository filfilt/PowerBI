Part19.Translation
This is to use Conditional Operator as: =IF(conditionl,resultl,IF(condition2result2,result3))
Eg:To change "Mark" to "Grade"
->Open the table
->Create New column
->fx: Grade = if([Mark]>90,"A",if([Mark]>80,"B",if([Mark]>70,"C",if([Mark]<70,"D"))))

NB: If the data value is changed from SQL Server, the Grad from Power BI also changed
